								<p>
									Hello and thank you so much for visiting my page and my Portfolio! I guess this is a good place to share a little about myself. I am a Nazia. I am a boy mom of two beautiful boys, one of whom has special needs. I am a crisis counselor turned health coach turned coding student enrolled in the first women's cohort at MIT. I am honored to be a part of the program and feel privelaged
									to be able to represent women in this emerging industry. As a special needs mother, it is very crucial for me to have a very structured and flexible work/life balance while
									having a secure career future and I am excited that I can have the best of both worlds in this industry. I am looking forward to learning and growing in this field and am open to  
									connecting and networking with other professionals in the field.
